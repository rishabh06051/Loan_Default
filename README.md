# Loan_Default

The objective of this repository is primarily to demonstrate the use of "faker" package in python to produce randomly generated dataset. In this particular example, I have taken the use case of loan default dataset, where the features are pre-decided. Subsequently, I have utilized the logistic regression algorithm on the generated dataset to perform binary classification prediction.
